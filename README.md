A free, offline text-to-speech reader for Android and iOS, built with Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform.

> Positioned as an open-source alternative to Speechify — no subscriptions, no internet required, no data leaves your device.

## Features

- **Import** — PDF, TXT, or paste text manually
- **Offline TTS** — native system voices on both platforms; high-quality neural Piper voices via sherpa-onnx (Android, iOS)
- **Paragraph highlighting** — current paragraph is highlighted in sync with playback
- **Reading progress** — app remembers where you stopped in every document
- **Library** — manage documents, mark favorites, sort by date
- **Adjustable playback** — speed control (0.5x–2.0x), voice gender, language, font size

## TTS Architecture

TextLector uses a two-tier TTS system:

**Phase 1 — Native TTS (default)**
Android `TextToSpeech` and iOS `AVSpeechSynthesizer` — available immediately, no downloads.

**Phase 2 — Neural TTS via Piper / sherpa-onnx**
[sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx) bundles a pre-compiled ONNX Runtime and eSpeak-NG, which means no manual C++ compilation or model conversion. Piper VITS models (~63MB each) are downloaded on demand from HuggingFace and stored locally.

Supported voices:
| Voice | Language | Gender |
|---|---|---|
| Ruslan | Russian | Male |
| Irina | Russian | Female |
| Ryan | English | Male |
| Lessac | English | Female |

The switch between native and neural TTS happens at runtime through `SwitchableTtsEngine` — no app restart required.

**Why sherpa-onnx over self-built Piper:**
Building Piper from source requires cross-compiling eSpeak-NG and ONNX Runtime for each target (arm64-v8a, x86_64, iOS arm64). sherpa-onnx ships pre-built XCFramework and AAR with all native libs included, reducing integration to a dependency declaration.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Meerkat or later
- Xcode 15+
- JDK 17+
- Kotlin 2.0+
### Android

```bash
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug
